# Ammo.js / Three.js
A list of resources for working with Ammo.js and Three.js developed for Queen's University QLAB project with the aim of creating a simulation of a robotic arm. My part of the project is focusing on motor simulation

All the code for the guides is outlined within them can be found in the folders.

I'd recommend working through the guides in the order below:
1. Setting up Ammo.js / Three.js
2. Ammo.js / Three.js Modelling Guide
3. Joint Constraints in Ammo.js / Three.js
