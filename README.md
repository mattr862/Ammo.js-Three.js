# Ammo.js / Three.js
A list of resources for working with Ammo.js and Three.js. Developed for a Queen's University QLAB project with the aim of creating a robotic arm simulation. My part of the project is focusing on modelling the motors physics. The larger project can be found here: https://github.com/MarkMegarry/QLAB-Robotics-Simulation

My motor simulation model is avalible under the motor sim folder.
The steps I used to develop this project have all been documented in the order listed below:

Firstly, If you haven't worked with Ammo.js / Three.js before i'd recommend checking out my PDF guide for setting it up - "Setting up Ammo.js / Three.js". see blank folder for the code.

The start of the development process of my motor sim code is outlined within my motor modelling PDF - "Motor modelling in Ammo.js / Three.js". see motor modelling folder for the code.
This document details -
1. Three.js Modelling / Ammo.js Meshes
2. Joint constraints
3. Input from keyboard to create rotation

The development is continued within the PDF - "Advanced Ammo.js / Three.js Guide" see advanced for the code. see Advanced folder for the code.
This document details -
1. Iterative shapes
2. Invisible shapes
3. Camera control
4. Compound shapes

I'm not in expert in working with any of the topics and this project on a whole is currently early in development. It is therefore not a guaranteed to behave as expected and instructions may be incomplete or incorrect.
