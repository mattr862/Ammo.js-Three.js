# Ammo.js / Three.js
A list of resources for working with Ammo.js and Three.js. Developed for a Queen's University QLAB project with the aim of creating a robotic arm simulation. My part of the project is focusing on modelling the motors physics.

The development process of my code is outlined within my motor modelling PDF "Motor modelling in Ammo.js / Three.js".
This document details -
1. Three.js Modelling / Ammo.js Meshes
2. Joint constraints
3. Input from keyboard to create rotation

If you haven't worked with Ammo.js / Three.js before i'd recommend checking out my PDF guide for setting it up - "Setting up Ammo.js / Three.j"
