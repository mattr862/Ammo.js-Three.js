# Ammo.js-Three.js
A list of resources for working with Ammo.js and Three.js developed for Queen's University QLAB project with the aim of creating a simulation of a robotic arm.

All the code for the guides is outlined within them can be found in the folders.

I'd recommend working through the guides in the order below:
1. Setting up Ammo.js / Three.js
2. Motor Modelling in Ammo.js / Three.js
3. Joint Constraints in Ammo.js / Three.js
